# AlienAttackGame
Creation of my Alien Attack Game used for Software Engineering

How the Game Works:
Aliens fall from the sky, avoid them by pressing the left and right arrow keys
the amount of aliens falling increases as the game progresses.
If you get hit by the alien your character reduces size, 3 hits and the game is over.
High scores are displayed on the right from previous games. restart the program to see if you made it on the leader board after the game ends.
